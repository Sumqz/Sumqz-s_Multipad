# Sumqz-s_Multipad
My own custom Macropad. It's simple but includes a variety of features. It's supposed to make life with a 60% Keyboard better. To get the space benefit of the small Keyboard but they possibility to add extra buttons and features when needed. This project was made possible by blueprint.hackclub.



It's baisically a Macropad on steroids, while it may only have 6 buttons, it also includes a rotary encoder wich handles volume as well as 2 RGB LED's with diffrent LED patterns. Theres also a OLED wich displays the Session time to keep track of how long you've been using your PC.

I made this project by following the tutorial on https://blueprint.hackclub.com/ and added a few of my own ideas. It took about 12-14 hours of work since i had to get used to the new CAD programm. It was a whole lot of fun.

The Firmware is easely changeable to fit everyones needs. Once assembled it just needs to get flashed and it should work right away.
